\chapter{Bob Dylan}
John the Baptist after poisoning a thief,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Saying tell me great leader, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?
 The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Saying death to all those who would whimper and cry.
And dropping a barbell he points to the sky,
Saying the sun is not yellow, it's chicken.
		-- Bob Dylan, "Tombstone Blues"

River: "I took you away from there."

Simon: "No."

River: "I know I did. You don't think I do, but... I get confused. I remember
everything. I remember too much and.... Some of it's made up and... some of
it can't be quantified and there's secrets..."

Simon: "It's okay."

River: "But I understand. You gave up everything to find me, and you found me
broken. It's hard for you. You gave up everything you had."

Simon: "Mei mei, everything I have is right here."

\chapter{HOW TO PROVE IT}

\section{proof by accumulated evidence:}

	Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.

\section{proof by cosmology:}

	The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or 
	meaningless. Popular for proofs of the existence of God.

\section{proof by mutual reference:}

	In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in 
	reference B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in 
	reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in 
	reference A.

\section{proof by metaproof:}

	A method is given to construct the desired proof. The 
	correctness of the method is proved by any of these 
	techniques.

\chapter{Otherness}

In a surprise raid last night, federal agents ransacked a house in search
of a rebel computer hacker.  However, they were unable to complete the arrest
because the warrant was made out in the name of Don Provan, while the only
person in the house was named don provan.  Proving, once again, that Unix is
superior to Tops10.

\section{deja-vu}

Over the years, I've developed my sense of deja vu so acutely that now
I can remember things that *have* happened before ...
