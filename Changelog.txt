v 1.0.3 6/08/2006
  This is a minor revision, most changes are subtle improvements on how 
  files are processed to pdf.

  I changed where the \hypersetup appears. 
  This makes it so that the pdfauthor pdftitle pdfkeywords now actually
  contain the info they are supposed to. 

  You can now manually set the keywords that the pdf will have by
  placing a 
    \keywords{}
  in the preamble to your document. Otherwise the default keywords 
  are the author and the title.

  Tried to add Unicode to the pdf format to make more accessible.

  Make pdf creator include a reference to BGSU.cls and the version number for
  easier debugging.

v 1.0.2 6/03/2006
  Changed the bibliography environment to automatically place it in the table 
  of contents.

v 1.0.1 5/30/2006

  Agata has pointed out to me that sometimes that class is adding extra spaces 
  between paragraphs trying to fill the page. I have added the appropriate 
  \raggedbottom command to fix this.

****************** WARNING ******************
****** These directions are outdated ********

  Agata also requested how to make the bibliography appear in the table of 
  contents. Placing an 

  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\bibname}

  right after your bibliography works. I have updated example.tex and 
  template.tex to reflect this.
************End Warning ********************
*********************************************
  I've added an option to the class to make the right margin "ragged"
  
  \documentclass[raggedright]{BGSU}

  This is not the standard \raggedright command (a quick google search 
  will produce documents telling why this ragged right is way too ugy.) 
  This is actually the \RaggedRight command from the package ragged2e.sty
  If anyone can test this please let me know how it works / looks. If it is 
  okay I will make it the default.

v 1.0.0 2/24/2006
  
  This is the first full release! All future releases will be based on fixes
  that people using this request and little bugs I might find. Here is what 
  Deborah Smith had to say about the formatting so far 
  (this is not a guarantee).

    Nate,


    I think you've done a really good job with this. I wouldn't have a
    problem with approving a manuscript formatted in this manner. Your fellow
    students should be very grateful for your efforts.

  Fixed the way pdfbookmarks are generated so they do not appear in table of
  contents.

  Also changed the way the table of contents, list of figures, list of tables
  are generated, so the pdfbookmark does not cut off section heading.
  
  Changed the formatting of pdfbookmarks and table of contents 
  so that reads like:
  
  Chapter 1 : Ch title

v 0.9.7 2/22/2006

  Added alternative spelling for acknowledgments: acknowledgements
  so \begin{acknowledgements} will work also and spell the title the way 
  you want. As far as I can tell both are valid spellings:

  http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=acknowledgement&db=*
  http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/acknowledgement#Alternative_spellings

  As far as I can tell the BGSU T/D handbook is using the UK spelling,
  why I have no idea.

v 0.9.6 2/15/2006

  Revised table of contents to try to more closely match ohiolink pdf 
  bookmarks. Still waiting to hear about the grad colleges opinion on this
  especially since LaTeX tends to make much more usable menulayers than
  what the graduate college has been adding.

v 0.9.5 2/14/2006
    
  Adjusted spacing for the masters thesis title page to more closely match
  graduate colleges' guidelines.

v 0.9.4 2/14/2006
  
  Added option "thesis" to class to take care of differences in title page 
  between a masters thesis and doctoral dissertation.

v 0.9.3 2/12/2006

  Fixed abstract environment typo.

v 0.9.2 2/10/2006

   I'm waiting to hear from my contact in the graduate college on how the
   PDF bookmarks should be formatted. She is not going to be back till next
   Thursday, so there may not be an update for a little while.
   
   Fixed geometry to be the "exact" standard specified by T/D Handbook.
   This took so long because something is messed up in my dvi processing 
   subsystem. I've verified that the geometry is correct on Doug's laptop.
   On a personal note, I think I know how to get my files correct now :-)

   Added references to table of contents for abstract, table of contents, 
   titlepage, listoffigures and listoftables. 
   This makes them appear as PDF bookmarks!

   Fixed some typos in the DeclareOptions

   Added some options to be passed to hyperref. These options depend on how
   you want to convert your document to pdf and ensure that your chapter 
   and section titles are made to be bookmarks. The options are as follows:

     dvips (default) If you use latex then dvips then ps2pdf to convert to pdf
     dvipdfm	     If you use latex then dvipdfm to convert to pdf
     pdftex	     If you use pdflatex to directly make pdf from tex

   Tried to do more elegant hack for the \chapter command.. The failed 
   attempt is commented out in the file.. I don't know why this doesn't work
   :-P 

v 0.9.1 2/9/2006
  
  Fixed the way BGSU.cls changes the page numbering. Now we simply pass the 
  argument: oneside to the book class. 
  (this may make it easier to switch to a different class if necessary)

  Added the following options that can be passed to the book environment:
  % a4paper
  % a5paper
  % b5paper
  % letterpaper
  % legalpaper
  % executivepaper
  % landscape
  % draft
  % final
  % openright
  % openany
  % leqno
  % fleqn
  % openbib
  To access simply place in options on documentclass line
  
  Adjusted spacing to be more correct in  \maketitle command.

  Added option runningheaders to use specify

  \documentclass[runningheaders]{BGSU}

  by default this option is off. Currently the grad college will accept
  running headers (supposedly) but officially they do not.

  Made "Advisor" appear on correct line in \maketitle command.

  Changed dedication environment to center text and move 2.5in down page

v 0.9 2/8/2006
  Fixed page numbering for new chapters.
  
  Fixed copyright page so that copyright is double spaced and appears at 
  bottom. 

  Added rubberspace at the top of the title page.

  Replaced \pagebreak in the custom environments and programs with
  \clearpage which formats better.

  Made advisor appear in correct spot on abstract page (flushright) 
  without making entire abstract flushright.

v 0.8 2/8/2006
  First public version
